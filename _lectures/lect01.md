* Gentle intro to github: what is a repo, creating a repo,  cloning a repo to a local machine, syncing repos with git add, commit and push

Software developers almost always prefer to use github's command line tools for version control instead of the web interface.

* Read the articles on [creating a github repo under an organization](https://ucsb-cs16.github.io/topics/github_com_create_private_repo_under_org/), [cloning your first repo](https://ucsb-cs56-pconrad.github.io/topics/git_cloning_your_first_repo/) and [git basic workflow](https://ucsb-cs56-pconrad.github.io/topics/git_basic_workflow/).
